Customer Discount Eligibility
Youâ€™re building a logic module for a billing system. Based on customer data, you need to evaluate whether they are eligible for a discount or a senior citizen privilege using if statements.

Tasks:
    Create three variables:
        - customer_name = "Amit"
        - customer_age = 24
        - total_purchase = 1200

If total_purchase is greater than 1000, print "Eligible for discount".
If customer_age is greater than or equal to 60, print "Senior Citizen".

customer_name = "Amit"
customer_age = 24
total_purchase = 1200

if total_purchase > 1000:
    print("Eligible for discount")
    
if customer_age >= 60:
    print("Senior Citizen")
