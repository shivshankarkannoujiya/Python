Delivery Charge Calculator
You’re building a delivery system for an e-commerce platform. Depending on the distance of the customer’s address, different delivery charges apply.

Tasks:

    - Take input from the user for delivery distance in Kilometers and store it in a variable named distance.

        - If the distance is 2 km or less, return the string: "Delivery charge: 0"

        - If the distance is greater than 2 km but not more than 5 km, return the string: "Delivery charge: 30"
        
        - If the distance is greater than 5 km but not more than 10 km, return the string: "Delivery charge: 50"
        
        - If the distance is more than 10 km, return the string: "Delivery not available for your location."
