Restaurant Billing System
You’re designing a billing system for a restaurant. Depending on the total bill amount entered by the customer, they might get a free dessert.


Tasks:
    - If the bill amount is greater than 500, return the string "You get a free dessert!"
    - Otherwise, return the string: "No free dessert this time."
