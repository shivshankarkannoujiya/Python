Loan Eligibility Checker
You’re building a basic loan eligibility checker for a bank. A customer must meet two conditions to be eligible:

Tasks:
    - If the user’s age is 21 or above, check:
    - If income is 25,000 Bucks or above, return: "Eligible for loan"
        - Otherwise, return: "Not eligible: Income too low"
    -   If the user’s age is less than 21, return: "Not eligible: Age must be 21 or above"
"""

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
income = int(input("Enter your income: "))

if age >= 21:
    if income >= 25000:
        print("Eligible for loan")
    else:
        print("Not eligible: Income too low")
else:
    print("Not eligible: Age must be 21 or above")
